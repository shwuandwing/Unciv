# Unciv - Civ V remake for Android & Desktop

![](/extraImages/3DPreviewImage.jpg)

## What is this?

This is a fork of [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/).  The goal is to see what a 4X turn based strategy game feels like with spherical based tiling.  In this case, the tiling is on a [goldberg polyhedra (class 1)] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_polyhedron) based on an isocahedron.

## Is this any good?

On the icosahedron map, Unciv plays as it should.  Units movement works, there is a 3d view, and a [2d view](/extraImages/Screenshots/2DIcosahedron.png) of the icosahedron that is unwrapped.

## How do I install?

- [Build from scratch](https://yairm210.github.io/Unciv/Developers/Building-Locally/#without-android-studio)

## What's the roadmap?

In this order:

* Try to make a map based on the Earth
